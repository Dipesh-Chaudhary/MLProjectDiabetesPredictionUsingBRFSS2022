  **This project was to predict diabetese using ML with the help of BRFSS 2022 data set.**
  
	 • Downloaded SAS data provided by CDC
	 • Converted it into csv(i.e. converted for ml usable format) for further usage
	 • Data cleaning and preprocessing was done
	 • Feature extraction was done
	 • Comparison between k-nn and naive baye's model was done 
	 • Best performing model between them (k-nn model) was built from scratch
	 • Validation and Evaluation was done of our newly built model from scratch on our preprocessed dataset
	 • Web app was made using streamlit 
	 • [Deployment was done through Streamlit cloud](https://predict-diabetese.streamlit.app/)
  [Deployed model](https://predict-diabetese.streamlit.app/)
